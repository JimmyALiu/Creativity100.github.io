      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Sophomore pursuing a B.S. in computer science at the University of Washington Seattle. I have four years of coding 
        experience working as a hobby, working on personal projects and competing in competitive programming tournaments, along 
        with two years of university courses. My strengths include problem-solving, adaptability, and communication. I'm looking 
        to expand my career and learn new things!

        This is a website I made from scratch to put everything I've learned in one place. This inculdes my knowledge on web 
        programming, but also all my other projects I've worked on over the years.

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Problem-solving</li>
        <li>Adapability</li>
        <li>Fast Learner</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Communication is a very important skill which I honed during the two years I
        participated in a club called the Fireside Coding Club. I worked closely
        alongside club members to do things like discuss and compete in USACO
        competitions, and building simples games in Unity. Because I spent so much
        time programming during this time, I also became proficient at not only 
        coding, but also at reasoning and problem-solving in order to write or debug 
        my code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another skill that I pride myself in is my ability to learn new things quickly, 
        and adapt to any situation I am faced with. These are both skills that have 
        greatly helped me in my journey as a programmer, and which I hope will continue 
        to help me as I expand my career and continue to learn more.
