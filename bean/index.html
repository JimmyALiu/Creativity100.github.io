  A website where you can bulid your own mazes, or have random mazes generated with optional size
  parameters. Each square is a position, which can either be empty (movable) or a wall (impassable)
  All images made by me.

      <h1>supper cool awseome website xd XD</h1>
      <h1>Maze Solver</h1>
      <p>Create a maze and submit it to see if it can be solved</p>
      <p>The maze begins in the top left and the end point is the bottom right button</p>
      <p>You can only move in the 4 cardinal directions, not diagonally</p>
      <p>Add rows and columns to expand the maze</p>
      <p>Click on the tiles in order to turn them into impassable walls</p>
      <p>The maze is navigated on the tiles, with each square being a movable space or a wall</p>
      <p>You cannot change the top left button because it is the starting point</p>
      <p>Empty tile will be represented by the word bean</p>
      <p>Walls will be represented by a bean image</p>
      <p>All images were made by me using ms paint in like 2 seconds</p>
      <p>Bean display on the right -&#62;&#62;&#62;</p>
      <p>
        Maze size is capped at 15 because I feel like it if you don't like it
        then go make your own website &#62;:(
      </p>
      <p>
        *You can't remove rows or columns. This is a FEATURE and not a DESIGN FLAW and NOT
        because im lazy. It forces you as the user to be MINDFUL of the decisions you make,
        especially when you can't take them back. I think this says a lot about society
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also randomly generate a maze of random size by default, or control the width
        or height using the input boxes next to it. Putting in an invalid value (like -1) will
        generate a random size
